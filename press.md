## Evidence-Based Management & CORE Skills

### Don’t Be Too Quick to Dismiss “Soft Science” (Scientific American, 2019)

This article argues that research in psychology and organizational behavior often has effect sizes comparable to many widely accepted medical or pharmaceutical interventions. It challenges the idea that “soft” sciences are somehow less rigorous or useful, and reinforces the case for applying evidence-based insights from I-O psychology to leadership, hiring, and culture.

## Wealth, Happiness, and Goal Content

### The Goods Life: China’s Wealth and Happiness Paradox (THINK.IAFOR, 2017)

This piece explores why decades of economic growth in China have not led to proportional gains in happiness. It draws on Easterlin’s paradox, Self-Determination Theory, and my research on Chinese employees’ income, aspirations, and well-being—highlighting how materialistic goals can dampen the happiness benefits of higher income.

### How Does Valuing Money Affect Your Happiness? (Greater Good Science Center, 2017)

Written by Jill Suttie, this article synthesizes several studies on money, self-worth, and happiness, and features my work on Chinese employees’ values and well-being. It underscores that:

- People who place a high value on money tend to be *less* satisfied with their income, even when they earn more.
- Intrinsic values like relationships, community, and growth are more reliable paths to well-being than materialistic goals.

## Crisis, Change, and the Future of Work

### Coronavirus: The Opportunity of Crisis (THINK.IAFOR, 2020)

This essay frames COVID-19 as a global “forced experiment” in stress, resilience, and social support. It explores how crises reveal underlying vulnerabilities in systems and individuals, and how leaders and policymakers can treat disruptions as opportunities to design more humane and resilient workplaces.

### Covid Crisis and Opportunity (The European Financial Review, 2022)

This article applies organizational psychology to questions of co-location, remote work, and innovation. It discusses how hybrid work can both expand opportunities and undermine well-being and informal collaboration if not thoughtfully designed, and offers guidance to leaders on reducing isolation and supporting meaningful challenge.
