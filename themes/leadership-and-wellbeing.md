# Leadership, Well-Being, and Organizational Effectiveness

This section highlights connections across several of my publications on stress, social support, meaningful work, change agency, motivation, and future-of-work skills.

Rather than a single program of studies, these papers reflect recurring interests in how people experience work and how organizations can design roles, leadership, and systems that support both effectiveness and well-being.

See the individual publication summaries for details and applied implications.
