# Leadership, Well-Being, and Organizational Effectiveness

This theme page highlights connections across several of my publications on stress and support, meaningful work, organizational change, motivation, and future-of-work skills.

The individual papers were not designed as a single program of research, but they share recurring interests in:

- How people experience well-being and meaning at work  
- How supervisors and social context shape that experience  
- How psychological resources and goal orientations relate to change, performance, and satisfaction  
- How human and relational skills matter for the future of work

For detailed methods and applied implications, see the individual publication summaries.
