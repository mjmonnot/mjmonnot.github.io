**Authors:** Jennifer Parlamis & Matthew J. Monnot  
**Journal:** *Journal of Management Inquiry, 28*(2), 225–227  
**DOI:** 10.1177/1056492618818023

## 1 · TL;DR

This essay argues that the label **“soft skills”** is misleading and devalues the very capabilities that are central to modern organizational effectiveness.

The authors propose the term **CORE skills – Competence in Organizational and Relational Effectiveness** – to emphasize that these are:

- Critical to performance and leadership,
- Observable and measurable,
- Trainable and developable.

---

## 2 · Context and Rationale

- The term “soft skills” has roots in 1970s U.S. Army training language and has long carried an implicit contrast with “hard” technical skills.
- Contemporary research in **emotional intelligence**, **relational leadership**, and **team effectiveness** consistently shows that these “soft” skills predict performance, retention, and culture outcomes.
- Employers repeatedly cite these capabilities as top priorities, including in the World Economic Forum’s *Future of Jobs Report 2025*, where analytical thinking, resilience, leadership, and social influence top the list of needed skills.¹

## 3 · Key Points

- Language shapes practice: if we call these skills “soft,” we risk funding and prioritizing them as though they are optional.
- Reframing them as **CORE** invites:
  - Rigorous measurement,
  - Serious inclusion in competency models,
  - Investment in systematic development.

## 4 · Implementation Ideas

### For Leaders & HR

- Replace the phrase **“soft skills”** in competency frameworks and job descriptions with **CORE competencies**, with behavioral anchors.
- Make CORE skills a visible part of:
  - Hiring criteria,
  - Performance reviews,
  - Promotion decisions.

### For Education & L&D

- Embed CORE skills training throughout curricula and leadership programs rather than treating them as one-off workshops.
- Use evidence-based interventions from emotional intelligence and coaching research (e.g., Boyatzis, 2009; Cherniss, 2010).

### For Future-of-Work Strategy

- Use data from **Future of Jobs** and similar reports to validate investments in CORE skills as part of digital and AI-era transformation strategies.
- Frame CORE skills as the uniquely human layer that allows organizations to realize value from technology and structural change.
