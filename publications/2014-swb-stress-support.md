# Subjective Well-Being at Work: Disentangling Source Effects of Stress and Support on Enthusiasm, Contentment, and Meaningfulness (2014)

**Authors:** Matthew J. Monnot & Terry A. Beehr  
**Journal:** *Journal of Vocational Behavior, 85*(2), 204–218  
**DOI:** 10.1016/j.jvb.2014.07.005

## 1 · TL;DR

This paper shows that **who** stresses you and **who** supports you at work matters for how you feel.  
Supervisor-originated role stress is especially damaging to **meaningfulness** at work, while positive communication from coworkers can buffer some of the negative impact of stress.

The study also develops and validates a **non-hedonic (meaningfulness) scale** alongside enthusiasm and contentment, treating work well-being as **multi-dimensional** rather than a single index.¹

## 2 · Methodology (Technical)

- **Design:** Two linked studies using a large alumni sample from a Midwestern U.S. university.
- **Participants:**
  - Study 1: scale development sample (n ≈ 500).
  - Study 2: full structural model sample (n ≈ 1,300+).
- **Measures:**
  - Work stressors by **source** (e.g., supervisor, coworkers, organization, non-work).
  - Social support / communication by source.
  - Subjective well-being at work, operationalized as:
    - **Enthusiasm** (positive activation),
    - **Contentment** (calm satisfaction),
    - **Meaningfulness** (eudaimonic significance of work).
- **Analyses:**
  - **Item-level IRT** (graded response models in IRTPRO) to develop and refine the meaningfulness scale.
  - Confirmatory tests of the three-factor SWB structure.
  - **Moderated structural equation models** (LISREL) to estimate source-specific paths from stress and support to each SWB dimension, including interactions between stress and support.²

## 3 · Methods in Plain English

Two things happen in this paper:

1. A new scale is created to measure **how meaningful people find their work**, complementing how energetic (enthusiastic) and satisfied (content) they feel.
2. The authors test how stress and support from **different people** (especially supervisors vs coworkers) relate to these three kinds of well-being.

Employees reported:

- How stressed they felt by their supervisor, coworkers, and others.
- How much positive or negative communication and support they received.
- How enthusiastic, content, and meaningful their work felt.

The models then disentangled **which source** predicts which aspect of well-being.

## 4 · Key Findings & Nuances

- The three-factor model (enthusiasm, contentment, meaningfulness) fits well; meaningfulness behaves as a distinct, non-hedonic dimension of SWB at work.
- **Supervisor role stress** has a particularly strong negative relationship with **meaningfulness**, beyond other sources of stress.
- Positive coworker communication/support is associated with higher enthusiasm and can **buffer supervisor stress** to some extent.
- Not all support is helpful: the broader literature (including Beehr’s work) shows that negative or ambivalent forms of “support” can sometimes worsen strain, which this study helps clarify by specifying **source and content**.³

## 5 · Implementation Ideas

### For Leaders & HR

- Treat supervisors as **primary shapers of meaning**, not just task managers.
- Monitor and address supervisor-driven role stress (unclear roles, conflicting expectations, overload).
- Explicitly train leaders in:
  - Communicating purpose and significance of work,
  - Providing clear, consistent expectations,
  - Using supportive, not undermining, communication styles.

### For People Analytics

- Measure well-being as **three related but distinct outcomes**:
  - Enthusiasm,
  - Contentment,
  - Meaningfulness.
- Include items that distinguish **source-specific stress and support** (supervisor vs coworkers vs organization).
- Model interactions such as **coworker support × supervisor stress** to identify units where peer climate is buffering poor leadership, or where both are misaligned.

### For OD / L&D

- Use this paper to justify programs that:
  - Combine **role clarity interventions** with leadership training.
  - Build **peer support and positive communication norms** at the team level.
- When evaluating interventions, track which aspects of SWB move:
  - Some changes will lift enthusiasm but not meaning, or vice versa; that pattern is diagnostic.
