# Marginal Utility and Economic Development: Intrinsic Versus Extrinsic Aspirations and Subjective Well-Being Among Chinese Employees (2017)

**Author:** Matthew J. Monnot  
**Journal:** *Social Indicators Research, 132*(1), 155–185  
**DOI:** 10.1007/s11205-015-1153-9

## 1 · TL;DR

This paper examines how **intrinsic versus extrinsic aspirations** relate to subjective well-being among Chinese employees as income rises.

Key points:

- Income shows **diminishing marginal utility** for happiness: initial gains matter more than later ones.
- Employees oriented toward **intrinsic aspirations** (growth, relationships, contribution) report higher well-being across income levels.
- Strong **materialistic orientation** weakens the happiness returns of additional income.

## 2 · Methodology (Technical)

- **Design:** Cross-sectional survey of employees in China.
- **Sample:** Employees across a range of industries and income levels (national sample).
- **Measures:**
  - Aspirations and goal content (intrinsic vs extrinsic), aligned with Goal Contents Theory.
  - Subjective well-being indicators (life satisfaction and related measures).
  - Income and demographic covariates.
- **Analyses:**
  - Regression models examining linear and **curvilinear** (e.g., quadratic) relationships between income and well-being.
  - Interaction terms to test whether **intrinsic vs extrinsic goals** moderate the marginal utility of income.¹

---

## 3 · Methods in Plain English

Employees reported:

- How important different goals are to them (personal growth, relationships, community vs money, status).
- How satisfied they are with their life and circumstances.
- Their income level.

The analysis checked:

1. Whether income “buys” less extra happiness at higher levels than at lower levels (diminishing marginal utility).
2. Whether that pattern looks different for people with **intrinsic versus extrinsic goal orientations**.

## 4 · Key Findings & Nuances

- Replicates the classic finding that income has a **non-linear** relationship with well-being.
- Demonstrates that employees who place greater emphasis on intrinsic aspirations:
  - Report higher well-being overall,
  - Show **less dependence on continued income growth** for satisfaction.
- In contrast, strong extrinsic/materialist aspirations are associated with:
  - Lower well-being,
  - Stronger sensitivity to income differences and comparisons.

These results prefigure the later cross-national work with Beehr, highlighting how **goal content** shapes the experience of economic development at the individual level.

## 5 · Implementation Ideas

### For Organizations in Rapidly Developing Contexts

- Recognize that **pay increases alone** will not sustain engagement and well-being as economies mature.
- Build people strategies that:
  - Highlight growth, mastery, and contribution,
  - Support meaningful relationships at work,
  - Avoid signaling that success is *only* about pay and status.

### For People Analytics

- Include intrinsic/extrinsic aspiration items in engagement or culture surveys.
- Model interactions between **income bands** and **goal orientation** to identify segments at risk of dissatisfaction despite competitive pay.

### For Leadership & Coaching

- Use goal clarification exercises (e.g., self-concordant goal work) to help leaders and employees align career paths with **intrinsic motives**.
- Frame promotion decisions and reward structures to reinforce **good-life** rather than purely **goods-life** messages.
