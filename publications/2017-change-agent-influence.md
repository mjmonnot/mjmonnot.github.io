# Organizational Change Agent Influence: A Conditional Process Model of Key Individual Psychological Resources (2017)

**Author:** Matthew J. Monnot  
**Journal:** *Journal of Change Management, 17*(3), 268–295  
**DOI:** 10.1080/14697017.2016.1237534

## 1 · TL;DR

This study examines why some internal change agents are more influential than others during organizational change.

It proposes and tests a model in which:

- **Cognitive ability** and **personality** (e.g., conscientiousness, emotional stability) form a base of **stable traits**, while
- **Psychological Capital (PsyCap)** – hope, efficacy, resilience, optimism – acts as a **state-like, developable resource** that helps convert traits into actual influence.

> Core idea: organizations should **select for potential and develop for capacity** when building internal change-agent pipelines.¹

---

## 2 · Methodology (Technical)

- **Design:** Cross-sectional field study using a structured organizational change simulation.
- **Participants:** Employees assigned to internal change-agent roles in a staged organizational change context.
- **Measures:**
  - General cognitive ability.
  - Big Five personality facets relevant to achievement and stability.
  - Psychological Capital (PsyCap).
  - Behavioral ratings of **change agent influence** during the simulation.
- **Analyses:**
  - Conditional process modeling using **PROCESS for SPSS**, testing:
    - Direct effects of cognitive ability and personality on influence.
    - Indirect effects through PsyCap.
    - Conditional paths and resource interactions.²

## 3 · Methods in Plain English

Employees were placed in a realistic change scenario and asked to act as **change agents** – persuading others, communicating the case for change, and helping the “organization” adapt.

They completed:

- Ability and personality assessments,
- A PsyCap questionnaire.

Observers and/or peers then rated how **influential** they were in the change process.

The analysis asked:

- Do smarter, more emotionally stable and conscientious people have more influence?
- Does **PsyCap** explain part of this effect?
- Are there conditions under which these resources matter more?

---

## 4 · Key Findings & Nuances

- Stable traits (cognitive ability and key personality facets) are positively associated with change influence.
- PsyCap is also positively related to influence and mediates portions of the trait–influence relationship.
- The model reflects a **resource caravan** idea: traits and state-like resources combine, rather than compete, to predict effectiveness.
- The nuance is not just “smart, confident people do better” – it is that **change influence is best understood as a dynamic interplay of stable and malleable resources**, which opens the door to development rather than fatalism about “natural change leaders.”

## 5 · Selection + Development Integration

This paper sits at the intersection of **selection science** and **developmental interventions**.

- **Selection:** Decades of meta-analytic work show that **general cognitive ability** and **conscientiousness** are robust predictors of job performance across roles and settings (Schmidt & Hunter, 1998; Barrick & Mount, 1991).
- **Development:** Research on **PsyCap** demonstrates that hope, efficacy, resilience, and optimism are **state-like** and can be increased through focused, brief interventions (Luthans et al., 2006; Luthans et al., 2010).

Together, they support a practical formula:

> **Select for potential, develop for capacity.**

1. Use valid assessments of cognitive ability and personality in selecting or nominating change agents.
2. Post-selection, invest in **PsyCap-building micro-interventions** to help those individuals deploy their potential under real-world uncertainty and resistance.
3. Track PsyCap and related resources over time as **leading indicators** of change readiness and influence (Avey et al., 2008).

## 6 · Implementation Ideas

### For Leaders & HR

- Identify internal change agents using **both**:
  - Evidence-based trait assessments,
  - Observed influence behaviors.
- Build development paths that:
  - Strengthen **PsyCap** through reflective exercises, mastery experiences, and positive reframing.
  - Provide coaching on specific influence tactics (framing, coalition building, storytelling).

### For People Analytics

- Model change outcomes (adoption, speed, local engagement) as a function of:
  - Trait profiles (ability, personality),
  - PsyCap levels,
  - Network position (if data available).
- Use these models to:
  - Locate “quiet” but highly resource-rich employees,
  - Inform the design of change teams and sponsor–agent pairings.

### For OD / L&D

- Embed PsyCap exercises drawn from Luthans et al.’s protocols into change training:
  - Guided goal-pathways work (hope),
  - Confidence and efficacy-building activities,
  - Resilience narratives and reframing,
  - Optimism practices grounded in realistic appraisal.
- Use simulations similar to the research design to practice, observe, and coach change influence behaviors in psychologically safe environments.
