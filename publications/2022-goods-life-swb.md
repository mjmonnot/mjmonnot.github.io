# The Good Life Versus the “Goods Life”: An Investigation of Goal Contents Theory and Employee Subjective Well-Being Across Asian Countries (2022)

**Authors:** Matthew J. Monnot & Terry A. Beehr  
**Journal:** *Journal of Happiness Studies, 23*(3), 1215–1244  
**DOI:** 10.1007/s10902-021-00447-5

## 1 · TL;DR

Using data from tens of thousands of respondents across Asian countries, this study investigates how **goal content** – intrinsic versus extrinsic aspirations – relates to subjective well-being and satisfaction with income, job, life, and accomplishments.

Findings broadly support **Goal Contents Theory**:

- People who prioritize **intrinsic goals** (health, safety, relationships, community, growth) report higher satisfaction.
- Strong **materialistic (goods-life) orientation** is associated with lower satisfaction, even when controlling for income.
- Income shows **diminishing marginal utility**, and materialism can worsen that flattening.

## 2 · Methodology (Technical)

- **Design:** Cross-national survey analysis using AsiaBarometer data.
- **Sample:** Over 40,000 respondents from multiple Asian countries and regions.
- **Measures:**
  - Intrinsic goal orientations: indices capturing importance of health, security, affiliation, community, and growth.
  - Extrinsic goal orientation: importance of money/material goods.
  - Outcomes: satisfaction with **income, job, life, and accomplishments**.
  - Country-level **Human Development Index (HDI)** as a contextual variable.
- **Analyses:**
  - Construction of **relative goal-orientation indices** (intrinsic vs extrinsic).
  - Regression and curvilinear models examining income–satisfaction relationships and interactions with goal orientation.
  - Multilevel modeling of intrinsic needs and HDI, including **multilevel item response theory (MIRT)** to assess measurement properties across countries.¹

## 3 · Methods in Plain English

Respondents indicated:

- How important different life domains are to them (e.g., health, family, community, money).
- How satisfied they are with their income, job, life, and personal accomplishments.
- Objective data on their country’s human development level were added.

Analyses then:

1. Grouped people based on whether they emphasize **intrinsic** or **extrinsic** goals.
2. Evaluated how that orientation relates to various satisfaction measures.
3. Checked how **income** relates to satisfaction and whether those patterns differ for materialists vs intrinsically oriented individuals.
4. Examined how **country-level development** relates to intrinsic need satisfaction.

## 4 · Key Findings & Nuances

- Intrinsic goal orientation predicts **higher satisfaction** across income, job, life, and accomplishments.
- Materialism is consistently associated with **lower satisfaction**, including lower satisfaction with income itself.
- The marginal benefit of income to satisfaction **diminishes** at higher income levels.
- Countries with higher HDI tend to have populations with **stronger intrinsic orientations**, supporting the idea that as societies develop, people increasingly look beyond material concerns.

## 5 · Implementation Ideas

### For Leaders & HR

- Avoid over-relying on compensation narratives in employment branding and employee value propositions.
- Highlight opportunities for:
  - Growth and mastery,
  - Health and security,
  - Community and contribution.
- Use this evidence to support investment in **purpose, autonomy, and community-building** initiatives.

### For People Analytics

- Include brief **goal-orientation** items in engagement or culture surveys.
- Model how intrinsic vs extrinsic orientation relates to:
  - Turnover intentions,
  - Burnout,
  - Satisfaction with pay and career prospects.
- Explore whether teams with a stronger intrinsic orientation respond differently to changes in pay or organizational performance.

### For Coaching & L&D

- Integrate **values and goal-content reflection** into coaching programs.
- Use exercises based on **self-concordant goals** and Self-Determination Theory to help leaders and employees align work with intrinsic motives.
